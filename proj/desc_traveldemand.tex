\subsection{Travel demand data}\label{ch:desc_traveldemand}

Travel demand data was obtained and prepared as described in \Cref{appx:travel_demand_data_prep}. The preprocessed travel demand data is a quite simple time series containing number of passenger boardings for each date, time in terms of the hour of the day, and date of week. \Cref{tab:travel_demand_data_attr} shows the attributes in the travel demand date set, and \Cref{tab:travel_demand_data_example} shows an example of the data set. Notice that \gls{day_i}, \gls{daytype_i}, and \gls{peek_i} are simply calculated measures that will come in handy later in the analysis.

\Cref{fig:travelcard_boxplot} shows the boxplot of passenger boardings over the different days of week, where the notches gives a roughly 95\% confidence interval for comparing medians cf.~\citet{Boxplots}. The plot suggests that travel demand of Monday--Thursday could follow quite similar distributions, while Friday, Saturday and Sunday seems to each have a distinct travel demand distribution from the rest of the week.

Intuitively travel demand also varies throughout the day as shown in~\Cref{fig:travelcard_hist}: On an average weekday, most passengers boardings are in the morning peek hours (7--9), and afternoon peek hours (15--18). It suggest that the weekdays seem to behave very similar between early morning and work hours (e.g.\ 2--16), except Friday, which looks to have more demand in general. After 16 the weekdays seem to deviate from each other a bit more. It also suggest that weekends has a clearly different demand pattern, with much more demand in the night hours.
