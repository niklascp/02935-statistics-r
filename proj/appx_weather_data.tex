\subsection{Acquisition and preparation of historical weather data}
\label{appx:weather_data_prep}

Historical weather data are unfortunately often still considered an asset, and therefore rarely public accessible in detailed granularity. Even though the Danish government has opened a lot of public data, and made them accessible for free use, data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) is still not freely available.

\emph{Weather Underground}\footnote{https://www.wunderground.com/} provides world covering weather forecasts and therefore has huge amount of historical weather data. They have an API, which also includes a free student/research plan, which gives (limited) access to historical weather data. Because the API only allows querying for on day at a time, a small \emph{Python} script was written to scrap the API for 6 months of historical weather data between October 2017 and March 2017.
