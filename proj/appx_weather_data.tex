\subsection{Acquisition and preparation of historical weather data}
\label{appx:weather_data_prep}

Historical weather data are unfortunately often still considered an asset, and therefore rarely public accessible in detailed granularity. Even though the Danish government has opened a lot of public data, and made them accessible for free use, data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) is still not freely available.

\emph{Weather Underground}\footnote{https://www.wunderground.com/} provides world covering weather forecasts and therefore has huge amount of historical weather data. They have an API, which also includes a free student/research plan, which gives (limited) access to historical weather data. Because the API only allows querying for on day at a time, a small \emph{Python} script was written to scrap the API for 6 months of historical weather data between October 2017 and March 2017.

The data was prepossessed, where some weather conditions were consolidated to simplify the analysis, and because they were too sparse independently as shown in \Cref{tab:consolidated_cond}.
